# traze

For my final project at The Iron Yard, I chose to make an app for the local metro system.  The app allows users to navigate metro using rider reports - each issue reported is stored externally and called using a custom API (Parse). 

Includes:
- MapKit with Current Location
- Parse backend
- JSON of WMATA API
- Custom UI - buttons, images
- Reachability
